# TestVagrant-Assignment
This project is to compare any Indian movie release date and country in IMDb and Wikipedia. I have used Selenium, Java, Maven, TestNG, data driven testing (reading the movie name from excel sheet), POM, Apache poi.
To change the movie name - go to testData/InputData excel file and enter the movie name there to search in IMDb and Wikipedia
