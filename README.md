# TestVagrant_MovieAssignment
The assignment is to compare the Release Date and Country of an Indian movie in IMDb and Wikipedia. The technologies used in this project includes Selenium + Java, Maven, POM, TestNG, Apache POI and data driven testing. The movie name can be changed from the InputData excel sheet found in testData/InputData. The TestNG cases and annotations can be found in the class TestCases(src/test/java/com/testVagrant/tests). The code is browser independent i.e can be used across Chrome, Firefox and Edge.
